#summary Details of how XML-RPC methods should declare their signatures and help sections

= Introduction =

Method introspection in django_xmlrpc is an issue because the XML-RPC dispatcher that it uses, SimpleXMLRPCServer.SimpleXMLRPCDispatcher, doesn't support the system.methodSignature() method.

= Proposed Signature Format =

Perhaps the simplest (but not the nicest) way to declare method signatures is to add them as to the exposed functions as attributes, thus:

{{{
def some_xmlrpc_func(spam, eggs):
    return "Value of spam: %s, value of eggs: %s" % (spam, eggs)

# Add a method signature for the function
some_xmlrpc_func.xmlrpc_signature = {'returns': string, 'args': [string, string]}
}}}

The dispatcher can then check for these when system.methodSignature() gets called. If a signature can't be found for a given method the dispatcher can then respond appropriately.
