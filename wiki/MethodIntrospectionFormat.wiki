= Note =

*This page is not applicable to the trunk or the 0.1 release*.

To use the functionality described on this page you need to use the introspection-dev branch, available [https://code.launchpad.net/~codedragon/django-xmlrpc/introspection-dev here].

= Introduction =

Method introspection in django_xmlrpc is an issue because the XML-RPC dispatcher that it uses, SimpleXMLRPCServer.SimpleXMLRPCDispatcher, doesn't support the system.methodSignature() method.

In order to get around this, django_xmlrpc subclasses SimpleXMLRPCDispatcher and looks for a signature property on each XML-RPC-registered method when system.methodSignature() is called on that method.

The method signature can be added using the decorator `@xmlrpc_func`.

= Adding a Signature to a Function =

You can add an XML-RPC signature to a method using the `xmlrpc_func` decorator:

{{{
from django_xmlrpc.decorators import xmlrpc_func

@xmlrpc_func(returns='string', args=['int', 'string',])
def hanging_on_the_wall(number, item):
    return "There are %i %ss hanging on the wall" % (number, item)
}}}

Bear in mind that if you don't specify a signature for a function, the XML-RPC dispatcher will take a punt on what the signature might be and will tell the client that the function's return type and arg types are all strings.
