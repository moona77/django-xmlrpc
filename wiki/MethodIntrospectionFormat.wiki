Method introspection in django_xmlrpc is an issue because the XML-RPC dispatcher that it uses, SimpleXMLRPCServer.SimpleXMLRPCDispatcher, doesn't support the system.methodHelp() and system.methodSignature() methods. This is most likely because they're not straightforward to implement in a dynamic language like Python.

This page will define how django_xmlrpc will handle the support of system.methodHelp() and system.methodSignature().
